![59 St Station Traffic Levels by 4-hour period.](https://github.com/mehiks11/Metis_MTA_Project/blob/master/Images/59_ST.png?raw=true width=432 height= 288)

The above plot depicts an example of the type of visualed guidance for travel that will be provided by station and line. 
I used the sum of exits and entries to indicate activity or traffic in the station during certain 4 hour periods. The hours indicate the starting period for a four hour period. This plot suggest that the best time to travel is early in the morning, late at night, and definetely before noon, where traffic seems to surge for the rest of the day.
